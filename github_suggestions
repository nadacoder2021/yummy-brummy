Hi Nada,

Just wanted to let you know about two cool things you can add to your github profile and any readme.

This [link](https://github.com/Ileriayo/markdown-badges) has loads of markdown badges you can add. For example:

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)

This [link](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) shows your github profile. Have a look at my profile to see how it looks.
